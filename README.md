- 👋 Hi, I’m @dulle90griet, also known as Donald.
- 🌱 I’m currently building an [ELT pipeline using **dbt**, **Snowflake** and **Apache Airflow**](https://github.com/dulle90griet/necars-elt-pipeline-sf).
- 🖼️ Outside of that, I'm learning more about extracting text from images using the various OCR and AI services offered by **Google Cloud**, **Azure** and **AWS**, and working my way through the CLRS _Introduction to Algorithms_.
- 🎯 Next, I aim to deepen my familiarity with **asynchronous programming in Python**.
- 👀 Why not check out some of the repos I'm working on?
